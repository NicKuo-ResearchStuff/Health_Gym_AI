# Health Gym Implementation Series

<img src="Supporting_Images/ZFig016_ImplementationSeries.png" alt="Health + Data Illustration" width="300"/>

Hey, hello, and Kia Ora!

Welcome to the Implementation Series of the Health Gym.  
This is where we roll up our sleeves and walk through step-by-step worked examples, showing exactly how to move from raw tables to model-ready data and embeddings, and how feature schemas and data loaders intertwine in practice.

If you’ve seen the Health Gym overview, you’ll know the big picture.  
Here, we zoom in to the nuts and bolts of how synthetic ART for HIV datasets are prepared and used.

## What is this series?

This series is created to help you understand the mechanics behind our worked examples.
* Each post is a Colab-friendly walkthrough with runnable code; and
* each step builds on the last, so you can follow sequentially or jump in where relevant.

---

### [Implementation 04: Rethinking Feature Schema and Data Loading](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation04)

A reflective blog post uncovering the "white lies" we told about reshaping and feature schemas, showing how data loading and embedding are in fact inseparably linked.

---

### [Implementation 05: Shuffling Feature Schema + DataLoader](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation05)

This post shows how feature schema and DataLoader come together, with one-hot expansion handled cleanly inside a unified pipeline.

---

### [Implementation 06: Curriculum Learning with Nested DataLoaders](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation06)

We build multiple DataLoaders of increasing sequence lengths and use them in curriculum style, so the WGAN trains from short to long horizons within each epoch.

---

### [Implementation 07: Health Gym v1: An LSTM-based WGAN](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation07)

This post discusses how LSTM is embedded a GAN architecture to power the generation of realistic sequences of synthetic EHR time series.

---

### [Implementation 08: Health Gym v1: The Eye of the Critic, Part 1](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation08)

This post dives into how the Health Gym v1 critic "rates realism" by scoring real data, fake data, and generator outputs during WGAN-GP training.

---

### [Implementation 09: Health Gym v1: The Eye of the Critic, Part 2](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation09)

This post unpacks the critic’s roles in -- scoring interpolated real–fake sequences and applying the gradient penalty via input-space derivatives -- to enforce 1-Lipschitzness and stabilise training.

---

### [Implementation 10: Health Gym v1: One Does Not Simply Create Synthetic Data, Part 1](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation10)

A walkthrough of how the Health Gym WGAN-GP generator transforms noise into schema-aware synthetic patient sequences that the critic uses to learn realism.

This post supplements blog 10 and discusses how the Health Gym generator learns from the critic’s feedback.

---

### [Implementation 12: Health Gym v1: The Learning Dynamics of GAN Sub-models](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation12)

This post covers a visual exploration of how the Health Gym v1 WGAN-GP’s critic and generator gradually reach equilibrium—revealing smoother, more balanced learning dynamics across training epochs.

---

### [Implementation 13: Health Gym v1: Eyeballing the Results](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI/tree/main/Blogs/Blogs_Z_Implementation/Implementation13)
